# PROJECT: NEXT âœ¨

Welcome to the Project: Next! This repository contains the code for a project developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Plop](https://plopjs.com/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and with an Atomic approach.

## Technology Used and Approach ðŸ’»

The project utilizes the following technologies and approach:

1. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A powerful framework for building modern web applications.
2. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and customization.
3. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances development safety, productivity, and maintainability.
4. [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) - A code generator that automates repetitive tasks and maintains code consistency.
5. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - A testing framework for writing comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality.
6. [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - A tool for building and documenting components in isolation, streamlining the design and development workflow.
7. Atomic Approach - A design methodology that organizes components into atoms, molecules, and organisms for better reusability and maintainability.

## Local Setup ðŸš€

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/paoloLigsay/projectnext.git`
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
4. Open your preferred browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the project in action.

## Component Generation ðŸ§©

To generate new components, follow these steps:

1. Run the command: `yarn generate`
2. Choose one of the following options: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms
3. Once selected, a sample folder structure will be generated for the chosen component type. For example, if you choose an Organism, the following folder structure will be created:

```
â””â”€â”€ components
      â””â”€â”€ organisms
        â””â”€â”€ componentName
          â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
          â”œâ”€â”€ componentName.stories.tsx
          â”œâ”€â”€ componentName.test.tsx
          â”œâ”€â”€ componentName.tsx
          â”œâ”€â”€ componentName.styles.tsx
          â””â”€â”€ componentName.interface.tsx
```

This structure provides a standardized setup for the new component, including necessary files for implementation, testing, styling, and interface definition.
